### Description
> This is one phase of the Airbnb Clone: the HTML and CSS part. The Images
> folder holds icons for the site (e.g. logo, bathroom icons, bedroom icons,
> guest icons). The Styles folder holds CSS styling files. The largest numbered
> style file of each category (e.g. common, footer, header, places) is most
> relevant to the finished product. The highlest numbered index.html file is
> likewise the most relevant to the finished product.
